Organization and conventions for the markdown that ships in
`data-content`. Each section below has its own per-content-type page;
this one covers the directory layout, file naming, and translation
workflow.

## Directory layout

```

## Content types

Each content type has its own dedicated page in this section:

- [Wiki Entry](@/contributing/content/wiki-entry.md) — encyclopedia-style
  definitions
- [Article](@/contributing/content/article.md) — long-form, idea-driven,
  evergreen
- [Newsroom Dispatch](@/contributing/content/newsroom-dispatch.md) — short,
  event-anchored
- [Library Book](@/contributing/content/library-book.md) — books with
  paragraph IDs
- [Translations](@/contributing/content/translations.md) — i18n workflow
- [Editorial Passes](@/contributing/content/editorial-passes.md) — what the
  `editorial_pass` field means

## File naming conventions

- Lowercase
- Hyphens for spaces: `age-of-aquarius.md`
- Match URL slugs
- Keep names short but descriptive

## Section index files

Each section needs an `_index.md`:

```toml
+++
title = "Wiki"
description = "Encyclopedia of terms and concepts"
template = "wiki-section.html"
sort_by = "title"
+++

Optional section introduction text.
```

## Sources

The `/sources/` page is JSON-driven — its content comes from
`data/sources.json`, built by `scripts/build_sources.py` in the www repo.
The build also generates per-source detail pages at `/sources/{id}/`
for English and localized shells at `/{lang}/sources/{id}/` from
`content/sources/_generated/*.md` and `content/{lang}/sources/_generated/*.md`.
It also writes a reverse `data/sources/cited-by.json` index for the
`Cited by` blocks. Those generated stubs are not hand-authored; the
underlying source record stays single-sourced in `data/sources.json`.

## Translations

Translations mirror the English structure:

```
wiki/elohim.md           # English source
de/wiki/elohim.md        # German translation
fr/wiki/elohim.md        # French translation
```

For the full translation workflow, glossary use, and per-language notes,
see [Translations](@/contributing/content/translations.md).
